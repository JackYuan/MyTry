This is my first git commit through gitolite.

cd test_gitolite
git clone gitolite@gitolite:testing
cd testing
emacs README

And now I am here.
And now I am here.

I am making this checkin through my personal github account (adamsd5), which has been added as a collaborator to Eladian's github account on the 'testing' repository.
